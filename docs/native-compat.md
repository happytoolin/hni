# Native Compatibility

`hni` native mode is an optimization for common local script and local bin execution.

It is not intended to perfectly reimplement every package manager's runtime behavior.
When a project layout or shell environment is likely to be package-manager-specific, `hni` should fall back to delegated execution instead of guessing.

## Summary

| Package manager | `nr` native | `nlx` native | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| npm | Yes | Yes | Common local `scripts` and `node_modules/.bin` flows are supported. |
| pnpm | Yes | Yes | Includes local `.bin` lookup and pnpm hoisted `.bin` paths when present. |
| yarn classic | Yes | Yes | Works with standard `node_modules/.bin` layouts. |
| yarn berry (node-modules linker) | Yes | Yes | Supported when the project exposes real filesystem bins. |
| yarn berry (PnP) | No | No | Falls back because PnP does not provide normal `node_modules/.bin` semantics. |
| bun | Yes | Yes | Supported for local script and local bin execution. |
| deno | No | No | Always delegated in v1 native mode. |

## Command Support

| Command | Native support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nr` | Yes, when eligible | Runs `pre<script>`, `<script>`, and `post<script>` in order. |
| `node run` | Yes, same as `nr` | Inherits the same native checks and fallbacks. |
| `nlx` | Yes, local bins only | Uses native execution only when a local executable can be resolved confidently. |
| `node exec` / `node x` / `node dlx` | Yes, local bins only | Inherits the same local-bin behavior as `nlx`. |
| `ni`, `nci`, `nu`, `nun`, `na` | No | These remain delegated to the detected package manager. |
| `np`, `ns` | Already native | These are not controlled by `nativeMode`. |

## Native Resolution Rules

For native `nr`:

| Behavior | Status |
| --- | --- |
| nearest `package.json` script lookup | Supported |
| forwarded args | Supported |
| `pre<script>` / `post<script>` hooks | Supported |
| `INIT_CWD`, `npm_lifecycle_event`, `npm_lifecycle_script`, `npm_execpath`, `npm_node_execpath`, `npm_package_json` | Supported |
| package-manager-specific env expansion such as `npm_package_*` / `npm_config_*` inside script bodies | Not supported |
| package-manager-specific loader environments such as Yarn PnP | Falls back |

For native `nlx`:

| Resolution source | Status |
| --- | --- |
| nearest ancestor `node_modules/.bin` | Supported |
| pnpm hoisted `.bin` under `node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules/.bin` | Supported |
| nearest package `package.json` `bin` entries | Supported |
| remote package fetch/exec | Not supported, falls back |

## Windows

Windows native support is intentionally conservative.

| Case | Status |
| --- | --- |
| ordinary native `nr` script execution | Supported |
| direct executable local bins | Supported |
| `.cmd` / `.bat` local bins | Supported via `cmd /C` |
| `.ps1` local bins | Supported via PowerShell |
| `.js` / `.cjs` / `.mjs` local bins | Supported via the resolved real Node binary |
| package-manager-specific shim behavior beyond these cases | Falls back or should be run with `--no-native` |

## When To Skip Native Mode

Prefer `--no-native` for:

- Yarn Berry Plug'n'Play projects
- projects that depend on package-manager-specific shell or env expansion
- cases where you want exact package-manager behavior for debugging
- Windows projects that rely on complex wrapper scripts or custom shell setup

Examples:

```bash
nr --no-native build
nlx --no-native create-vite@latest
node run --no-native dev
```

## Design Principle

If native execution is not clearly correct, `hni` should delegate instead of approximating package-manager behavior.
