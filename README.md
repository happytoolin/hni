Fast package manager routing for `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `bun`, and `deno`.

`hni` is inspired by Antfu's [`ni`](https://github.com/antfu-collective/ni#readme), but packaged as a single multicall binary with extra shell setup for a `node` shim.

`hni` is still beta software and may have bugs.

One install gives you:

- `hni`
- `ni`, `nr`, `nlx`, `nu`, `nun`, `nci`, `na`, `np`, `ns`
- `node` shim via `hni init <shell>` (shell plugin only)

## Install

### npm (global)

```bash
npm install -g @happytoolin/hni
hni --version
```

This installs `hni` and the `ni`-family aliases (`ni`, `nr`, `nlx`, `nu`, `nun`, `nci`, `na`, `np`, `ns`) onto your global npm bin path.
The `node` shim is only enabled through `hni init <shell>`.
Under the hood, npm resolves a platform-specific optional dependency package that contains the native `hni` binary.

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap happytoolin/happytap
brew install hni
hni --version
```

### Script install (macOS / Linux)

TODO: `https://happytoolin.com/hni/install.sh` is not live yet. Use the raw GitHub script for now:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happytoolin/hni/main/install.sh | bash
```

Optional environment variables:

- `HNI_VERSION` - install a specific version, for example `v0.0.2`
- `HNI_INSTALL_DIR` - install somewhere other than `~/.local/bin`
- `HNI_NODE=off` - disable the `node` shim for the current environment

### Script install (PowerShell)

TODO: `https://happytoolin.com/hni/install.ps1` is not live yet. Use the raw GitHub script for now:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/happytoolin/hni/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

Optional parameters:

- `-Version latest`
- `-InstallDir "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\hni\bin"`

### Deno / JSR

Install `hni`:

```bash
deno install -gA -n hni jsr:@happytoolin/hni/hni
hni --version
```

Install alias commands (example):

```bash
deno install -gA -n ni jsr:@happytoolin/hni/ni
deno install -gA -n nr jsr:@happytoolin/hni/nr
```

## Commands

### `ni`

Install dependencies or add new ones.

```bash
ni
ni vite
ni -D vitest
ni -g eslint
ni --frozen
ni --frozen-if-present
ni --interactive
```

### `nr`

Run package scripts.

```bash
nr
nr dev
nr build
nr test -- --watch
nr --if-present lint
```

### `nlx`

Execute binaries without adding them permanently to your project.

```bash
nlx vitest
nlx eslint .
nlx create-vite@latest
```

### `nu`

Upgrade dependencies.

```bash
nu
nu react react-dom
nu --interactive
```

### `nun`

Remove dependencies.

```bash
nun lodash
nun react react-dom
nun --multi-select
nun -g typescript
```

### `nci`

Run a clean install. If a lockfile exists, `hni` uses the package-manager-specific frozen install command.

```bash
nci
```

### `na`

Print or forward directly to the detected package manager.

```bash
na --version
na config get registry
```

### `np` / `ns`

Run shell commands in parallel or sequentially.

```bash
np "pnpm dev" "pnpm test"
ns "pnpm lint" "pnpm test"
```

### `node`

`hni` can also act as a package-manager-aware `node` shim.
Enable it by adding `hni init <shell>` to your shell config first.

```bash
node install vite
node run dev
node exec vitest
node ci
node p "echo one" "echo two"
```

Regular Node.js usage still passes through:

```bash
node script.js
node -v
node -- --trace-warnings
```

### Utilities

```bash
hni help ni
hni completion zsh
hni init bash
hni doctor
```

## Shell Setup

If you want node-shim behavior, add the init line at the end of your shell config file, after anything that manages Node or rewrites `PATH`, such as `nvm`, `mise`, `asdf`, `fnm`, or `volta`.

Do not append the `hni` directory to the end of `PATH`. Put the init line at the end of the shell config file and let it prepend the correct path for you.

### zsh

Add to `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(hni init zsh)"
```

### bash

Add to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
eval "$(hni init bash)"
```

### fish

Add to `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
hni init fish | source
```

### PowerShell

Add to `$PROFILE`:

```powershell
Invoke-Expression (& hni init powershell)
```

### Nushell

Generate a stable init file, then source it from the end of `~/.config/nushell/config.nu`:

```nu
hni init nushell | save --force ~/.config/nushell/hni.nu
source ~/.config/nushell/hni.nu
```

## Global Flags

These work across `hni` and the multicall aliases:

```bash
? --dry-run --print-command
--explain
-C <dir>
-v --version
-h --help
```

Use `--` to forward flags to the underlying package manager or script:

```bash
hni ni -- --help
nr test -- --watch
```

## Configuration

Config file:

- `~/.hnirc`

Supported keys:

```ini
defaultPackageManager=pnpm
globalPackageManager=npm
fastMode=true
```

Environment overrides:

- `HNI_CONFIG_FILE`
- `HNI_DEFAULT_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
- `HNI_GLOBAL_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
- `HNI_FAST_MODE`

## How It Works

`hni` detects the package manager from:

1. `packageManager` in `package.json`
2. lockfiles such as `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`, `bun.lockb`, or `deno.lock`
3. config defaults if detection is unavailable

Then it maps the command family to the right native command:

- `ni` -> install or add
- `nr` -> run or task
- `nlx` -> `npx` / `pnpm dlx` / `yarn dlx` / `bun x`
- `nu` -> update / upgrade
- `nci` -> frozen install when lockfiles exist

## Troubleshooting

### PowerShell `ni` alias conflict

PowerShell ships with a built-in `ni` alias for `New-Item`.

If that conflicts with `hni`, remove or override it in your profile before loading `hni`:

```powershell
Remove-Item Alias:ni -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Invoke-Expression (& hni init powershell)
```

### Check what `hni` resolved

```bash
ni vite --debug-resolved
nr dev --explain
hni doctor
```

## Benchmarking

The active benchmark suite lives in [`benchmark/`](benchmark/).

If you use [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), the common local commands are wrapped in [`justfile`](justfile):

```bash
just build-release
just test
just test-native
just ci
just bench
```

Run all benchmark tracks with:

```bash
./benchmark/run.sh
just bench
```

Run individual tracks with:

```bash
just bench-compare
just bench-native
just bench-runtime
just bench-direct

./benchmark/run.sh --track=compare
./benchmark/run.sh --track=native
./benchmark/run.sh --track=runtime
./benchmark/run.sh --track=direct
```

Generate flamegraphs with:

```bash
./benchmark/profile.sh
```

Tracked benchmark docs:

- current snapshot: [`benchmark/LATEST.md`](benchmark/LATEST.md)
- lightweight history: [`benchmark/HISTORY.md`](benchmark/HISTORY.md)
- native compatibility: [`docs/native-compat.md`](docs/native-compat.md)

### Representative Results

The current tracked snapshot is from March 22, 2026 and was generated with `50` warmups and `500` measured runs per case.

If you only want the headline, it is this: `hni --native` is meaningfully faster than normal package-manager usage on npm, pnpm, and yarn, still ahead on bun, and much less dramatic on deno.

The clearest story is the `direct` track, which compares what people normally type against `hni --native`. In the current snapshot, `hni` averages `4.90x` faster overall there.

A few representative wins:

| Case | Direct | `hni` native | Relative |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `task noop (npm)` | 207.83 ms | 36.63 ms | 5.67x |
| `task noop (pnpm)` | 418.28 ms | 32.26 ms | 12.97x |
| `task noop (yarn)` | 279.87 ms | 32.17 ms | 8.70x |
| `exec hello --flag (npm)` | 249.48 ms | 10.25 ms | 24.35x |
| `exec hello --flag (pnpm)` | 311.16 ms | 7.30 ms | 42.65x |
| `exec hello --flag (yarn)` | 104.92 ms | 7.48 ms | 14.02x |
| `exec hello --flag (bun)` | 15.07 ms | 7.46 ms | 2.02x |

The internal `native` track tells the same story from another angle: native mode averages `4.38x` faster than delegated mode inside `hni`. The local-bin case is especially strong in the current snapshot: `nlx hello --flag (npm local bin)` lands at `7.75 ms` natively versus `334.43 ms` in delegated mode.

The Antfu comparison is smaller and more lightweight, but still points the same way. On that track, `hni` averages `1.66x` faster overall, with `ni --version` coming in at `129.05 ms` for `hni` versus `334.60 ms` for Antfu's `ni`.

The main caveat is still Deno. In the direct task-style cases, `hni` is basically at parity there rather than dramatically ahead. In the separate runtime-style comparison, `hni` beats bun on both cases, while deno still wins the hooked-task case.

### Methodology

All timing uses `hyperfine` against the release binary. The suite looks at four angles:

- `direct`: normal package-manager usage versus `hni --native`
- `native`: delegated mode versus native mode inside `hni`
- `compare`: a small CLI-focused comparison against Antfu's `ni`
- `runtime`: a side-by-side look at `hni`, bun, and deno on a couple of task-style cases

The repo keeps the curated snapshot files rather than every intermediate result. For the full current matrix, use [`benchmark/LATEST.md`](benchmark/LATEST.md).
